# BasicAPI
An API that was meant to teach me a tech stack I was not very familiar with.

## About
This project is using:
- Go for its main application code
- Cassandra for data storage
- Kafka for message brokering
- Docker for containerising

## How to run this
In the root directory of this project, run `docker compose up`. This will create images and start up containers of the API and the local Cassandra database.

## Project Management
All of the project planning and management was done using Jira Service Management. A simple Kanban approach suffised for the small scope of this project.
